## Directory Purposes

### Core Files
- `.structure`: Provides this detailed overview of the project organization
- `README.md`: Quick start guide and project introduction
- `followThisWhiteRabbit.md`: Main tutorial document that tracks progress

### Levels
Progressive tutorial content with clear learning objectives:
- Each level has its own challenge requirements
- Higher levels are conceptually "locked" until previous level's mini-boss is completed
- Mini-boss challenges have clear victory conditions

### Solutions
Your workspace for implementing the challenges:
- Start empty except for .gitkeep files
- Create your solutions here as you progress
- Each level has its own directory to keep work organized

### Patterns
Reference examples and common configurations:
- Act as a cheat sheet for common Docker patterns
- Provide tested, working examples
- Include detailed comments explaining each pattern
- Serve as documentation for best practices

## Level Unlocking System
While we don't have technical locks, we use a progress tracking system:
1. Each level's mini-boss has clear victory conditions
2. Update followThisWhiteRabbit.md to track progress
3. Use git commits to mark completed challenges
4. Create git tags for major achievements (level completions)

## Git Branch Strategy
- `main`: Clean template with empty solution folders
- `myQuest`: Your personal journey branch
- Consider creating level-specific branches for larger challenges
