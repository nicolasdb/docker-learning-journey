## Directory Purposes

### Core Files

- `.structure.md`: Provides this detailed overview of the project organization
- `README.md`: Quick start guide, project introduction, and journey guide
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: Basic code of conduct

### Documentation (docs/)

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT_extended.md`: Detailed code of conduct guidelines
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the project
- `LICENSE`: Project license information

### RTFM (Read The Friendly Manual)

Comprehensive documentation covering:

- Basic Docker concepts and operations
- Container maintenance and monitoring
- Networking configuration
- Storage management and volumes

### Levels

Progressive tutorial content with clear learning objectives:

- Each level represents increasing complexity in Docker concepts
- Higher levels are conceptually "locked" until previous levels are completed

### Workbench

Your workspace for learning and experimenting:

- Track progress in progress.md
- Organized by level
- Contains both documentation and code
- Includes specific examples and configurations

## Level Progression

1. Start with level1-basics.md
2. Progress through levels sequentially
3. Document your journey in workbench/progress.md
4. Complete challenges at your own pace

## Contribution Guidelines

See docs/CONTRIBUTING.md for:

- How to suggest improvements
- How to report issues
- How to propose new content or examples
