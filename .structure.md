## Directory Purposes

### Core Files

- `.structure.md`: Provides this detailed overview of the project organization
- `README.md`: Quick start guide and project introduction
- `followThisWhiteRabbit.md`: Main tutorial document that tracks progress
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: Basic code of conduct

### Documentation (docs/)

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT_extended.md`: Detailed code of conduct guidelines
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the project
- `LICENSE`: Project license information

### RTFM (Read The Friendly Manual)

Comprehensive documentation covering:

- Basic Docker concepts and operations
- Container maintenance and monitoring
- Networking configuration
- Storage management and volumes

### Levels

Progressive tutorial content with clear learning objectives:

- Each level represents increasing complexity in Docker concepts
- Higher levels are conceptually "locked" until previous levels are completed

### Solutions

Your workspace for taking note and implementing the challenges:

- Organized by level
- Contains both documentation and code
- Includes specific examples like python-hello-world and hedgedoc configurations

## Level Progression

While we don't have technical locks, we use a progress tracking system:

1. Start with level1-basics.md
2. Progress through levels sequentially
3. Use git commits to mark completed challenges
4. Create git tags for major achievements (level completions)

## Git Branch Strategy

- `main`: Clean template with empty solution folders
- `myQuest`: Your personal journey branch
- Consider creating level-specific branches for larger challenges

## Contribution Guidelines

See docs/CONTRIBUTING.md for:

- How to suggest improvements
- How to report issues
- How to propose new content or examples
