# Contributing to Docker Learning Journey

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Docker Learning Journey as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Improving the learning materials
- Suggesting new learning paths
- Fixing documentation errors
- Proposing new exercises or challenges
- Becoming a maintainer

## Important Note

This repository is focused on the Docker learning journey and educational content. For technical Docker issues, bugs, or problems with Docker itself, please report them to the [official Docker repository](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/issues).

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you're adding new learning content, ensure it follows our existing structure.
3. Update any relevant documentation.
4. Make sure your content is clear and beginner-friendly.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the learning journey, if applicable.
2. Update the documentation with any new prerequisites or setup instructions.
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer.
4. Please use our pull request template - it helps ensure all necessary information is included.

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License 2.0

In short, when you submit changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report Issues Using GitHub's [Issue Tracker](../../issues)

We use GitHub issues to track content improvements, suggestions, and documentation issues. Please do not use this for Docker technical support - instead, refer to [Docker's official documentation](https://docs.docker.com) or [Docker's support channels](https://docs.docker.com/support/).

When creating an issue, please use:

- [Bug report template](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.md) for documentation errors, broken exercises, or unclear instructions
- [Feature request template](../../issues/new?template=feature_request.md) for suggesting new content or improvements to the learning journey

## Writing Good Issue Reports

**Great Issue Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary of the learning material in question
- What specifically needs improvement
  - Be specific!
  - Include references to relevant files or sections
- What you expected to learn or understand
- What was unclear or problematic
- Suggestions for improvement (if any)

## Coding Style Guidelines

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 100 characters
- Comment your code where necessary
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Keep examples simple and focused on learning

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature or learning content
- **fix**: A fix to existing content
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the content
- **refactor**: A content change that neither fixes an issue nor adds new material
- **test**: Adding missing tests or example solutions
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
