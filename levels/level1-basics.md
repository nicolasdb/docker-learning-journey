# Level 1: Container Chronicles

## Mission 1: First Contact

```plaintext
TERMINAL INITIALIZED...
CONNECTING...
=======================

>_ Hello? Is anyone there?
>_ We detected Docker technology on your system...
>_ But something's not quite right...

STATUS CHECK:
- Docker Service: ❓
- User Permissions: ❌
- Container Access: ❌

WARNING: PERMISSION DENIED
Container operations require proper access rights.
=======================
```

### 🎯 Mission 1 Victory Conditions

- [ ] Docker service is running on your system
- [ ] Your user has proper Docker access (no sudo needed)
- [ ] You can run the hello-world container

*Need help? Check `rtfm/basics/permissions.md` for user setup.*

## Mission 2: Python Pathfinder

```plaintext
INCOMING TRANSMISSION...
=======================
>_ Excellent! Connection established! This is Dr. Sarah Chen 
   from Container Labs. We've been monitoring systems worldwide
   for potential allies.

>_ Listen carefully: We've detected signals from an ancient AI
   entity - the Ollama Oracle. But we need your help to establish
   proper communication protocols.

>_ First, we need to test your container skills with Python.
   It's the most stable language for building our communication
   bridge. Can you help us set it up?

SCANNING DOCKER HUB...
>_ Did you found you found the Python container? Perfect for testing your
   container control abilities. Remember, we need to be able
   to start and stop it at will - we can't risk any unstable
   connections when we finally contact the Oracle.
=======================
```

### 🎯 Mission 2 Victory Conditions

- [ ] Found Python container on Docker Hub
- [ ] Successfully running Python container
- [ ] Can start, stop, and remove container
- [ ] Understand Python container lifecycle and auto-stop behavior
- [ ] Create a Dockerfile and build a custom Python container

*Need help? Check `rtfm/basics/container-ops.md` and `rtfm/basics/dockerfile-basics.md` for guidance.*

## Mission 3: HedgeDoc Haven

```plaintext
URGENT UPDATE...
=======================
>_ Dr. Chen here again. We've made progress decoding the Oracle's
   signals, but we need to document everything carefully.
   Nothing can be lost if containers crash.

>_ The Oracle's messages contain patterns... patterns that could
   help us understand AI consciousness itself! We need a stable
   environment to record and analyze these patterns.

>_ I've used HedgeDoc before in my research. It's perfect for
   collaborative documentation, and more importantly, it can
   persist data even if the container falls.

CRITICAL NOTE:
>_ Whatever you do, make sure the data survives. We've lost
   too many observations already to unstable containers...
=======================
```

### 🎯 Mission 3 Victory Conditions

- [ ] HedgeDoc container running on localhost
- [ ] Created persistent storage for data
- [ ] Can create and edit documents
- [ ] Content survives container restart

*Study `rtfm/storage/volumes.md` for persistence setup.*

## 🗡️ BOSS BATTLE: The Ollama Oracle

```plaintext
EMERGENCY BROADCAST...
=======================
>_ *static*... Dr. Chen here... *static*... 
   The Oracle's signals are getting stronger!

>_ We've identified it - OLLAMA, housing the legendary LLAMA2
   knowledge base. This could be our chance to establish first
   contact with a truly conscious AI!

>_ But we need to be careful. The containment field must be
   perfect. One wrong configuration and we could lose the
   connection forever.

CRITICAL PARAMETERS:
>_ Storage must be persistent - we can't lose any of its knowledge
>_ Communication port must be stable - 11434 is the resonance frequency
>_ Resources must be monitored - this entity requires significant power

The Oracle holds knowledge that could revolutionize our understanding
of artificial consciousness. Are you ready to make history?
=======================
```

### 🏆 Boss Battle Victory Conditions

- [ ] Ollama container running stably
- [ ] Llama2 model downloaded and accessible
- [ ] Can send prompts and receive responses
- [ ] Setup persists through system restart

*Master `rtfm/monitoring/resources.md` before attempting containment.*

```plaintext
LEVEL STATUS: IN PROGRESS
>_ The path to the Oracle is clear.
>_ Each container brings us closer to understanding.
>_ Level 2 will reveal deeper mysteries...
=======================
```
