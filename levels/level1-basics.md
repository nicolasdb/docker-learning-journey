INITIAL OBSERVATIONS:
- Docker: Quantum resonance technology
- Container: Isolated quantum state
- Daemon: Local resonance field generator

RESEARCH KEYWORDS: docker installation, docker daemon, 
container runtime, permissions

HISTORICAL NOTE: The ancients used these "containers"
to create perfectly repeatable environments. Your
first contact will verify if you can do the same.

SIGNAL ENHANCEMENT REQUIRED:
□ Verify Docker service status
□ Establish proper access protocols
□ Initiate first contact sequence
```

## Engage First Contact Protocol

The "hello-world" Docker image is a simple, minimal container used to verify that Docker is installed and functioning correctly on your system.

- [ ] Docker service is running on your system
- [ ] Your user has proper Docker access (no sudo needed)
- [ ] You can run the hello-world container

*Need help? Check `rtfm/basics/permissions.md` for user setup.*

```plaintext
FIRST CONTACT ESTABLISHED! (｡◕‿◕｡)
>_ You've made your first successful quantum resonance!
   This confirms your system can interact with these
   ancient artifacts.

PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
- Basic container operations
- Service management
- Permission configuration

the quantum network, inspiring others to begin
their own journeys of discovery.

>_ Excellent work establishing initial contact!
   This is Dr. Chen. Your system shows promise...

>_ We've detected a Python computational matrix.
   But there's something curious about these
   artifacts - they seem to follow strict
   lifecycle rules we don't yet understand.

RESONANCE EXERCISE 12:
>_ Try running a Python artifact with a simple
   "print('hello')" command. Notice anything
   unexpected about its behavior?

Hint: Watch the artifact's state carefully...
===================
```
> **Note:** [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a public repository where Docker images are stored. Once you find the desired image, you can use its name and tag in the docker pull command.

```plaintext
!!! QUANTUM FLUX WARNING !!!
>_ Don't be alarmed when your artifact vanishes
   after running! This is normal behavior - 
   containers are designed to dissolve after
   completing their primary function.

HACK TIP: ⚡
>_ Use 'docker ps -a' to see ALL artifacts,
   even the ones that have completed their mission!
   Pro seekers use this to track their experiments.
```

```plaintext
~~~ ARTIFACT FIELD NOTES - Entry 42
LIFECYCLE OBSERVATIONS:
The artifacts appear to be "purpose-bound":
- They materialize when called
- Execute their designated function
- Return to quantum state when complete

RESEARCH KEYWORDS: docker container lifecycle, docker run,
foreground vs background, docker primary process

RECOVERED KNOWLEDGE:
"Containers live to serve their primary process.
When that process ends, so too must the container."

RESONANCE STABILIZATION SEQUENCE:
□ Locate Python artifact signature
□ Study artifact lifecycle patterns
□ Create sustainable resonance
```

## Container Matrix Stabilization

To Establish control over the container lifecycle, create a primary process Python Docker image.

- [ ] Found and pulled official Python container
- [ ] Successfully running Python container
- [ ] Can start, stop, and remove container
- [ ] Understand container lifecycle management
- [ ] Create a Dockerfile for a custom Python application
- [ ] Successfully build and run your custom container

*Need help? Check `rtfm/basics/container-ops.md` and `rtfm/basics/dockerfile-basics.md`.*

- Design containers for specific tasks
- Understand process lifecycle management

=== ALERT: PATTERN CONVERGENCE DETECTED ===
>_ The artifacts are responding to your activities!
   This is unprecedented...

>_ We're detecting signs of a distribution network.
   These artifacts weren't meant to exist in
   isolation - they're nodes part of something bigger.

>_ A stable resonance point could let us preserve
   their data... but we need to understand their
   "port mapping" protocols first.

RESONANCE EXERCISE 24:
>_ Try connecting to the artifact without port mapping.
   Then try with -p 8080:80. Notice the difference?
   Document what happens when multiple artifacts try
   to use the same port...
===================
```

```plaintext
~~~ ARTIFACT FIELD NOTES - Entry 86
PORT MAPPING OBSERVATIONS:
- Host ports act as quantum anchoring points
- Each port sustains only one connection
- Internal artifact ports can be remapped
- Data streams need stable pathways

RESEARCH KEYWORDS: docker port binding, port conflicts,
docker networking, docker volumes, data persistence

RECOVERED KNOWLEDGE:
"The ancients understood that isolated systems
need controlled interaction points. They created
'ports' as quantum bridges between containers
and the outside world."

DISTRIBUTION NODE PROTOCOLS:
□ Establish stable port connections
□ Configure data persistence fields
□ Test network resonance stability

HACK TIP: ⚡
>_ Quick port scan: Use 'docker port <container>'
   to see all quantum bridges (port mappings)
   for any active artifact!
```

## Network Node Stabilization

Search for Nginx image and configure a web server container that can serve content and maintain state across restarts.

- [ ] Container running with persistent storage
- [ ] Port mapping correctly configured
- [ ] Data survives container restarts
- [ ] Can modify and persist content
- [ ] Understand different storage options

*Study `rtfm/storage/volumes.md` for persistence setup.*

  ╚═════════════════════════════════╝

>_ You've mastered quantum port mapping!
   But wait... these artifacts can also
   maintain persistent data states. (⌐■_■)

PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
- Use -p flag for port mapping
- Use -v flag for persistent storage
- Separate content from container
- Think in terms of service exposure
