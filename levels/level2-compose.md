# Stage 2: Network Command Center

## Mission 1: Compose Initiation

```plaintext
TRANSMISSION INCOMING...
=======================

>_ Commander Chen here. Your mastery of basic containers
   is impressive, but now we face a bigger challenge.

>_ Modern applications rarely work alone. They need to
   communicate, share resources, and work together in
   harmony.

>_ It's time to learn Docker Compose - our tool for
   orchestrating multi-container deployments.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
- Docker Compose installation
- Network configuration access
- Service coordination protocols
=======================
```

### 🎯 Mission 1 Victory Conditions

- [ ] Docker Compose installed and working
- [ ] Create first docker-compose.yml file
- [ ] Successfully run multi-container setup
- [ ] Understand service definitions

*Need help? Check `rtfm/networking/` documentation.*

## Mission 2: Network Navigator

```plaintext
FIELD REPORT...
=======================
>_ Excellent progress on Compose basics! But containers
   need to talk to each other securely and efficiently.

>_ Your next mission: Master container networking.
   Create a network of containers that can communicate
   while maintaining isolation from external threats.

>_ Remember: In the field, proper network configuration
   is the difference between success and failure.

NETWORK PARAMETERS:
>_ Custom network creation required
>_ Inter-container communication essential
>_ Port mapping for external access
=======================
```

### 🎯 Mission 2 Victory Conditions

- [ ] Create custom Docker network
- [ ] Configure inter-service communication
- [ ] Set up proper port mapping
- [ ] Implement service discovery
- [ ] Test network isolation

*Study networking documentation for detailed guidance.*

## Mission 3: Environment Engineer

```plaintext
URGENT DIRECTIVE...
=======================
>_ Security alert! We can't hardcode sensitive data
   in our container configurations.

>_ Your mission: Implement proper environment variable
   management and secrets handling.

>_ This is crucial for maintaining operational security
   while allowing for flexible deployment configurations.

SECURITY PROTOCOLS:
>_ Environment variables must be properly managed
>_ Sensitive data must be protected
>_ Configuration must be environment-aware
=======================
```

### 🎯 Mission 3 Victory Conditions

- [ ] Implement .env file usage
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Handle sensitive information properly
- [ ] Create different environment configs
- [ ] Test configuration isolation

*Reference the documentation for security best practices.*

## 🗡️ BOSS BATTLE: The Orchestration Challenge

```plaintext
PRIORITY ALERT...
=======================
>_ This is it - your final test in multi-container
   mastery! We need a complete, production-ready
   multi-container application.

>_ Requirements:
   - Multiple interconnected services
   - Proper networking
   - Environment configuration
   - Data persistence
   - Health checks
   - Container dependency management

>_ This challenge will test everything you've learned
   about Docker Compose and multi-container operations.

CRITICAL OBJECTIVES:
>_ All services must work together seamlessly
>_ System must be resilient to failures
>_ Configuration must be environment-aware
>_ Data must persist across deployments
=======================
```

### 🏆 Boss Battle Victory Conditions

- [ ] Complete docker-compose.yml configuration
- [ ] Multiple services working together
- [ ] Proper network configuration
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] Volume management for persistence
- [ ] Health checks implemented
- [ ] Service dependency order defined
- [ ] System survives service restarts

*Review all documentation before attempting this challenge.*

```plaintext
LEVEL STATUS: IN PROGRESS
>_ Your journey into multi-container orchestration continues.
>_ Master these skills to prepare for Level 3's challenges.
>_ The path to container mastery grows ever deeper...
