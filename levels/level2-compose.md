# Stage 2: Network Command Center

TRANSMISSION INCOMING...
=======================

>_ Commander Chen here. Your mastery of basic containers
   is impressive, but now we face a bigger challenge.

>_ We've detected a complex resonance pattern - multiple
   artifacts working in harmony, sharing data streams
   and coordinating their quantum states.

>_ It's time to master Docker Compose - our tool for
   orchestrating these intricate artifact networks.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
- Docker Compose installation
- Network configuration access
- Service coordination protocols
=======================
```

~~~ ARTIFACT FIELD NOTES - Entry 201
MULTI-ARTIFACT OBSERVATIONS:
- Compose: Advanced resonance orchestrator
- Services: Specialized artifact roles
- Networks: Quantum communication channels
- Volumes: Persistent data fields

RESEARCH KEYWORDS: docker-compose installation,
service definitions, network configuration,
container orchestration

HISTORICAL NOTE: The ancients used "Compose" to
weave complex tapestries of containers, each
playing its part in a greater symphony.

RESONANCE STABILIZATION REQUIRED:
□ Verify Compose installation
□ Create first orchestration template
□ Establish artifact communication
```

## Mission 1: Compose Initiation

### 🎯 Mission 1 Victory Conditions

- [ ] Docker Compose installed and verified
- [ ] Create first docker-compose.yml with Python Flask service
- [ ] Establish basic service split
- [ ] Test Flask "hit-count" webpage

*Need help? Check `rtfm/networking/` documentation.*

```plaintext
FIRST ORCHESTRATION ACHIEVED! (｡◕‿◕｡)
>_ Your artifacts are beginning to resonate together!
   This is just the beginning of their symphony.

PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
- Basic service definitions
- Container dependencies
- Environment configuration
- Volume management

Remember: Each service you add creates new
possibilities for artifact interaction!

*signal stabilizing*
>_ Excellent work on basic orchestration!
   But these artifacts need secure pathways
   to share their quantum states...

>_ We're detecting natural resonance patterns
   between services. They're trying to form
   their own network topology!

RESONANCE EXERCISE 201:
>_ Try connecting your services without explicit
   network configuration. Then add a custom network.
   Notice how their behavior changes?

Hint: Watch the quantum pathways carefully...
===================
```

```plaintext
!!! QUANTUM FLUX WARNING !!!
>_ Don't be alarmed by network isolation!
   Containers are meant to be selective
   about their communications.

HACK TIP: ⚡
>_ Use 'docker network ls' to see all quantum
   pathways available to your artifacts.
   'docker network inspect' reveals their
   deep connection patterns!
```

## Mission 2: Network Navigator

### 🎯 Mission 2 Victory Conditions

- [ ] Create custom Docker network
- [ ] Connect Flask and PostgreSQL services
- [ ] Configure Supabase service integration
- [ ] Set up proper port mapping
- [ ] Test inter-service communication
- [ ] Verify network isolation

*Study networking documentation for detailed guidance.*

=== ALERT: CONFIGURATION CONVERGENCE ===
>_ The artifacts are becoming more complex...
   They require specific quantum states to
   function properly.

>_ We've detected sensitive resonance patterns
   that must be protected. These 'environment
   variables' are crucial to their operation.

RESONANCE EXERCISE 302:
>_ Try running services with hardcoded values.
   Then switch to environment variables.
   Document the flexibility difference...
===================
```

## Mission 3: Environment Engineer

### 🎯 Mission 3 Victory Conditions

- [ ] Create .env file for configuration
- [ ] Configure Streamlit service variables
- [ ] Set up n8n workflow environment
- [ ] Handle sensitive data properly
- [ ] Test different environment configs
- [ ] Verify configuration isolation

*Reference the documentation for security best practices.*

   while keeping their secrets safe! (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
- Environment variable management
- Secret handling
- Configuration flexibility
- Security best practices

*** PRIORITY TRANSMISSION ***
>_ This is it - we're detecting a massive
   convergence of artifact resonance!

>_ The Python matrix, Supabase quantum core,
   Streamlit interface, and n8n automation...
   They're all aligning into something greater!

FINAL RESONANCE EXERCISE:
>_ Monitor the complete system. Watch how
   changes ripple through the artifact network.
   How do they recover from disruptions?

WARNING: System stability is critical!
===================
```
