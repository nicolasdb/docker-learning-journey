# migrating a docker container?

To migrate a Docker container with the changes you made (like installing a package) to another computer, you need to save the container as a new image and then transfer that image to the other computer. Here's how you can do it step by step:

---

## Container

### **Step 1: Commit the Container to a New Image**

Since you made changes to the container (e.g., installed a package), you need to save the container as a new Docker image.

1. Find the container ID or name:
2. Commit the container to a new image:

   ```bash
   docker commit <container_id_or_name> <new_image_name>
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Save the Image as a Tar File**

Now, save the new image as a `.tar` file so you can transfer it to another computer.

1. Save the image:

   ```bash
   docker save -o <output_file.tar> <new_image_name>
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Transfer the Tar File to the Other Computer**

Copy the `.tar` file to the other computer using a USB drive, network transfer, or any other method.

---

### **Step 4: Load the Image on the Other Computer**

On the other computer, load the `.tar` file into Docker.

1. Load the image:

   ```bash
   docker load -i <path_to_tar_file>
   ```

2. Verify the image was loaded:

   ```bash
   docker images
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Run the Container on the Other Computer**

Now you can run a container from the custom image on the new computer.

1. Run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -it <new_image_name>
   ```

## Volumes

> If you're using named volumes or bind mounts, you'll need to handle them separately when migrating your Docker setup to another computer.

- For named volumes, [back up the volume data](../storage/backup.md) to a .tar file, transfer it, and restore it into a new volume on the other computer.

- For bind mounts, simply transfer the directory (or its compressed archive) to the other computer and update the bind mount path in your Docker command.

If you're transferring both the container image (as a .tar file) and volume/bind mount data, make sure to handle them separately as described above.

That's it! You've successfully migrated your customized container to another computer. Let me know if you need further clarification! üê≥
