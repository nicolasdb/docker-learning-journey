# migrate ollama container

transfer this container to a beefier computer. 

1. commit the container = create an image from the container.
2. compress the image
3. move the .tar file to the other host
4. extract and run the image

Fuuuu**,
the model is actually saved in the named volume "ollama"

```bash
docker run --rm -v ollama:/source -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar czf /backup/ollama_backup.tar.gz -C /source .
```

> **Explanation of the Command**

- `docker run --rm`: Runs a container and removes it after it exits.
- `-v ollama:/source`: Mounts the Docker volume ollama to the /source directory inside the container.
- `-v $(pwd):/backup`: Mounts the current directory on the host to the /backup directory inside the container.
- `alpine`: Uses the Alpine Linux image (a lightweight Linux distribution).
- `tar czf /backup/ollama_backup.tar.gz -C /source .`:
  - `tar czf`: Creates a compressed tar archive.
  - `/backup/ollama_backup.tar.gz`: The output file (saved in the /backup directory, which is mapped to your current directory on the host).
  - `-C /source .`: Changes to the /source directory (where the volume is mounted) and archives its contents.

then

```bash
docker network create locallan
docker network connect ollamaqwen locallan
```

not usefull to access containers from two computers in the same network >>> use IP and port instead.

> Yes, you're absolutely correct! Let me clarify and summarize this for you:

### **Key Points**
1. **Docker Networks**:
   - Docker networks are primarily used to connect multiple containers **on the same host**.
   - Containers on the same Docker network can communicate with each other using their container names as hostnames (thanks to Docker's built-in DNS resolution).
   - Examples of Docker networks: `bridge`, `host`, and custom user-defined networks.

2. **Connecting Containers Across Different Computers**:
   - Docker networks **do not span across multiple hosts** by default.
   - To connect to a container running on another computer, you need to use the **IP address** of the host machine where the container is running.
   - Ensure the container's port is exposed and accessible on the host's network.

---

### **When to Use Docker Networks**
- Use Docker networks when:
  - You have multiple containers on the **same host** that need to communicate (e.g., a web app, database, and cache).
  - You want to isolate containers for security or organizational purposes.
  - You want to use container names instead of IP addresses for communication.

---

### **When to Use IP Addresses**
- Use IP addresses when:
  - You need to connect to a container running on **another computer**.
  - You don't want to set up advanced multi-host networking (e.g., Docker Swarm or Kubernetes).

---

### **Example Scenarios**

#### **1. Containers on the Same Host**
- Use a Docker network to connect them.
- Example:
  ```bash
  docker network create my_network
  docker run -d --name container1 --network my_network my_image
  docker run -d --name container2 --network my_network my_image
  ```
  - `container1` can access `container2` using `http://container2:port`.

#### **2. Containers on Different Hosts**
- Use the host's IP address to access the container.
- Example:
  - On **Computer A** (IP: `192.168.1.100`):
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name ollama -p 11434:11434 ollama-model-image
    ```
  - On **Computer B**:
    ```bash
    curl http://192.168.1.100:11434
    ```

---

### **Advanced: Multi-Host Networking**
If you want to avoid using IP addresses and prefer a more seamless setup for multi-host communication, you can use:
1. **Docker Swarm**:
   - Creates an overlay network that spans multiple hosts.
   - Containers can communicate using service names.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     docker swarm init
     docker network create --driver overlay my_overlay_network
     docker service create --name ollama --network my_overlay_network -p 11434:11434 ollama-model-image
     ```

2. **Kubernetes**:
   - Provides advanced networking and service discovery for multi-host environments.

---

### **Summary**
- **Docker networks**: Use for connecting containers on the **same host**.
- **IP addresses**: Use for connecting to containers on **different hosts**.
- **Advanced setups**: Use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for seamless multi-host networking.
